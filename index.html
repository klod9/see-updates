                    Honey, your patience with me, your genuine nature, and the purity of your love have created something so beautiful between us. 
                    Baby, just like what I have told you -we're like two puzzle pieces that fit perfectly together, bound by countless pinky promises and sealed with endless love. 
                    Every shared glance, every quiet moment, every laugh we've shared has woven us together in ways that feel destined. 
                    Baby, you truly are my soulmate, and I cherish every second of this incredible journey we're on together. Mahal na mahal kita baby ko!

                    Baby, I cannot express how deeply grateful I am to have you as the light in my life. Before you, my world felt incomplete, like I was wandering in darkness without knowing what I was searching for and I already shared them to you, yet here we are always accepting each other's past experienceand flaws along the way. 
                    Those darkness baby you... you illuminated all of it. John 1:5: "The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it." with you honey -you gave my life meaning, purpose, responsibility, sense of focus and a joy that would overcome the darkness and never knew was possible, honey you have brought this passage into my mind just by being with you. 
                    Without you, my days would be empty, my heart would be hollow, and my life would feel worthless. 
                    You are my sun, baby baby you're my sun and moon, my stars -you are everything that makes life worth living. 
                    Doc. Erich Anne Guevarra Palanca, Thank you for choosing to share your beautiful heart with me. I love you beyond words, beyond time, and beyond everything.
